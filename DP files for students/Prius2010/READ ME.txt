There are 6 MATLAB m files:

To run Dynamic Programming on the 2010 Prius, use
DP_Prius2010.m

To perform the soc correction on mpg, use 
mpg_soc_correction.m --> You need to mannually type in the soc and mpg values (need more than two data points). The script then uses "polyfit" to find the linear fit.

The following four files are only for visualization:
plot_BSFC.m --> plot the engine map
plot_CYC.m --> plot the driving cycle
plot_GEN_MTR_effmap.m --> plot the motor & generator maps
plot_soc_SoftConstraint.m --> plot the soft constraint on battery SOC
